# Personal Trees

A **Stardew Valley** mod that introduces tree ownership mechanics, allowing players to claim and manage their own trees
while preventing others from cutting them down.

## Features

- **Tree Ownership**:
    - Trees planted by a player automatically belong to them, and only they can cut them down.
    - Wild trees (trees that grow naturally) remain unowned and can be cut down by anyone.
- **Ownership Notifications**:
    - When a non-owner attempts to cut down a tree, they will see a message notifying them of the tree's owner.
    - Hover over the lower part of a tree to see a tooltip showing the owner's name.
- **Owner Portraits**:
    - A mini portrait of the tree's owner is displayed on the trunk of owned trees.
    - You can toggle these portraits on or off using a configurable keybind (default is `J`). Can be configured via
      **Generic Mod Config Menu** or in the `config.json` file located in the mod's folder.
